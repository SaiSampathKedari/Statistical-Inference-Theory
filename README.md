# Statistical Inference Theory - Casella-Berger - UMICH STATS 511 - MIT 18.650

This repository contains my **lecture notes** and **solved exercises** from *Casella-Berger: Statistical Inference (Chapters 6-9)*, along with supporting materials from **MIT 18.650: Statistics for Applications** and **UMich STATS 511: Statistical Inference**. The focus is on **point estimation, hypothesis testing, and interval estimation**, which are fundamental to **Machine Learning, AI, and Robotics**.

## Key Topics Covered
1. **Principles of Data Reduction**: Sufficiency, Minimal Sufficiency, Ancillary Statistics, Complete Statistics, and the Likelihood Principle.
2. **Point Estimation**: Methods of Moments, Maximum Likelihood Estimators, Bayes Estimators, The EM Algorithm, Methods of Evaluating Estimators, and Fisher Information.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Neyman-Pearson Lemma, Likelihood Ratio Tests, and Decision Theory.
4. **Interval Estimation**: Confidence Intervals, Bayesian Credible Intervals, and Large Sample Approximations.

## Repository Structure
- **Lecture Notes**: Summaries of theoretical concepts with detailed explanations.
- **Problem Sets**: Solutions to exercises from *Casella-Berger*, reinforcing understanding through problem-solving.
- **Supplementary Resources**: Notes from **UMich STATS 511** and **MIT 18.650** for additional perspectives.

## Purpose
This repository is dedicated to building a **strong foundation in Statistical Inference**, which is essential for **Statistical Machine Learning, Computational Statistics, and Probabilistic Robotics**. The concepts covered here are fundamental for **Monte Carlo Methods, Bayesian Filtering, and Smoothing**, which are widely applied in **State Estimation, Control Systems, and Robotics**.

By mastering these principles, I aim to bridge the gap between **theory and practical implementation** in **robotics and autonomous systems**, ensuring a rigorous mathematical understanding for designing **probabilistic models, filtering techniques, and decision-making algorithms**.

Whenever possible, I aim to document my work in **LaTeX** for clarity and professional presentation.
